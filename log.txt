Successfully found the position of the player and the ball
Used color filter to achieve this. The next step would be to
find their speeds and direction(acceleration if required)
Also bigger aim of moving the player automatically to a given
coordinate.

Dilemma on the tracking algorithm to use. Either the 
Color filtering or just using Hough filter. 
Need to average out the circles found on the image and
somehow decide if its a ball, player or goalpost.
Leaning towards color filter for that reason.
